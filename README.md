### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Data Corruption in PostgreSQL Database.
---

Data corruption in a PostgreSQL database refers to the loss, alteration, or invalidation of data stored in the database. This can occur due to various reasons like hardware or software failures, human errors, network issues, or malicious attacks. When data corruption occurs, it can cause several problems like data inconsistency, incorrect or incomplete data retrieval, system crashes, and even data loss. Recovering data from a corrupted PostgreSQL database requires specialized skills and tools. Preventing data corruption involves implementing measures like regular database backups, monitoring for system errors, and using robust data validation techniques.

### Parameters
```shell
export VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"

export SERVER_IP="PLACEHOLDER"

export DB_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export DB_PASSWORD="PLACEHOLDER"

export BACKUP_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export DB_USERNAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export TABLE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check the PostgreSQL database for any corruption
```shell
pg_dumpall | grep ERROR
```

### Check the status of PostgreSQL database
```shell
systemctl status postgresql
```

### Check the PostgreSQL logs for any error messages
```shell
tail -n 100 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-${VERSION}.log
```

### Check the integrity of the PostgreSQL database cluster
```shell
pg_verify_checksums -D /var/lib/postgresql/${VERSION}/main/
```

### Check the memory usage on the server
```shell
free -h
```

### Check the CPU usage on the server
```shell
top
```

### Check the Disk Usage on the server
```shell
df -h
```

### Check the network connectivity to the server
```shell
ping ${SERVER_IP}
```

### Check the PostgreSQL configuration settings
```shell
cat /etc/postgresql/${VERSION}/main/postgresql.conf
```

## Repair

### Restore data from a backup: If you have a recent backup of the database, you can restore the data from it. However, this may cause some data loss if the backup was not taken right before the corruption occurred.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Define the parameters

DB_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME}

DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}

DB_NAME=${DB_NAME}

BACKUP_FILE=${BACKUP_FILE}



# Stop the PostgreSQL service

sudo systemctl stop postgresql



# Drop the existing database

psql -U $DB_USERNAME -c "DROP DATABASE $DB_NAME"



# Create a new empty database

psql -U $DB_USERNAME -c "CREATE DATABASE $DB_NAME"



# Restore data from backup

pg_restore -U $DB_USERNAME -d $DB_NAME $BACKUP_FILE



# Start the PostgreSQL service

sudo systemctl start postgresql


```

### Repair corrupted tables: If only a few tables in the database are corrupted, you can try to repair them using the PostgreSQL tool called pg_resetxlog or pg_resetwal.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set variables

DB_NAME=${DB_NAME}

TABLE_NAME=${TABLE_NAME}



# Stop the PostgreSQL service

sudo systemctl stop postgresql



# Run the pg_resetxlog or pg_resetwal command to repair the corrupted table

sudo -u postgres pg_resetxlog -f /var/lib/postgresql/${VERSION}/main/pg_xlog

sudo -u postgres pg_resetwal -f /var/lib/postgresql/${VERSION}/main/pg_wal



# Start the PostgreSQL service

sudo systemctl start postgresql



# Verify that the table is repaired

sudo -u postgres psql -d $DB_NAME -c "SELECT * FROM $TABLE_NAME LIMIT 1;"


```
